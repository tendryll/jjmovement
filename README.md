# Individuals, Pods, and Clusters

_Live into the awe of reality, with all persons, in union with all things._

## Preamble

Each person's life is expressed uniquely by way of their language, religion (or non-religion), country, and other cultural attributes that one associates themselves with or are identified with. Yet, individuals need help to live their lives into their fullness. To do so requires help of others. This document proposes a simple methodology for the creation of social groups that will help the individuals in each group to better their lives and their community.

## Node, Pods, and Clusters

A node represents a person. A pod represents a group of individuals, preferably no bigger than nine members large. A cluster is a collection of pods.

Pods are composed of individuals that work together to, first, address their concerns and then, secondly, to work on addressing their community's concerns. It's left up to the pod to determine the process of achieving their goals. Clusters are composed of pods that work together to achieve goals that can't be achieved by any pod alone.

cluster = pod | node
pod = node {2,9}
node = person
